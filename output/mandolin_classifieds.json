These mandolins have a warm, bubbly tone that works well for jazz, Celtic and blues or just about any style of music that isn\u2019t bluegrass. (Bluegrass mandolins require the punch and power that only an F-hole mandolin can give you.) Like the mandolins that inspired it, the Kentucky KM-270 has a hand-carved and graduated solid spruce top.

Northfield mandolins are easily one of the best selling brands we carry here in our store.... And for good reason... It is hard to beat the quality, tone, and playability of these mandolins for the price. The Big Mon in particular has a wonderful woody tone with the bigger body size.. . The Big Mon body style is just slightly different than the standard size to create a little more midrange and bass response, with a nice airy sound. On this model, Northfield has increased the width of the body, at its widest point, by 5mm and also adjusted the depth\/width of the sides a little in a few places. Everything is in proportion to this change, so it results in a slightly larger body overall. It's not very noticeable unless you compare it directly to another standard size by lining them up back to back. The change is subtle aesthetically, but immediately apparent in terms of sound. The re-curve carved into the top is extended a little and the top, out towards the edges, has been thinned a bit. All curves are maintained so that the shape is very pleasing to the eye. The body flows into the waist area and continues the line up the side resolving to a very nice circular scroll, with a slightly larger button in the center. They've also changed the thickness for the back accordingly and vary that depending on the type of material we're using.

Gibson A-4 Model Carved Top Mandolin (1914), made in Kalamazoo, serial # 26988, red sunburst top, dark stained back and sides finish, birch back and sides, spruce top, mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, original black hard shell case.. . The Model A-4 was Gibson's highest priced \"A\"-style oval-bodied mandolin for much of the company's early history. This example is fairly early, dating to the beginning of 1914 when Gibson was fully established as the major force in the mandolin market. By this point, the Gibson mandolins had been improved in a number of ways, especially in regards to the \"modern\" sharper neck angle. The sound is fully developed compared to instruments from a few years or earlier, and genuinely superior (at least to modern ears) to anything else available at the time.. . This A-4's features include an early example of Gibson's celebrated sunburst top finish, a new idea just catching on at the time. This version is a subtly shaded dark\/light red hue over cherry stained back and sides, less flashy than some later 'bursts but no less attractive. The model is further distinguished by pearl and wire inlaid grained ivoroid buttons on the Handel tuners, a treble side fingerboard extension and a pearl fleur-de-lis below the Gibson logo on the headstock. The body and fingerboard are single-bound and the sound hole is bordered with a large ring of ivoroid in between half-herringbone strips. A lovely-sounding playable piece of Art Nouveau, and another fine example of the instruments with which Gibson first conquered the fretted world.. . Overall length is 25 1\/2 in. (64.8 cm.), 10 1\/16 in. (25.6 cm.) across at the widest point, and 1 13\/16 in. (4.6 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.).. . This is not a mint mandolin, but for just about 110 years along a solid and fine sounding one. There is an older sealed grain split to the top above the soundhole, sealed with some topical touch up but still fairly conspicuous. There are no other cracks. The finish is original apart from this spot, showing some general wear including fine checking, pick scrapes, dings and dents with some areas rubbed off the back of the neck.. . The hardware remains all original including the lovely inlaid tuners, tailpiece and cover, segmented bridge and elevated celluloid pickguard. The mandolin has been neatly refretted with Jescar SS wire, the modern option closest in feel to the period Gibson standard with a rounder crown and rather longer wearing than the nickel\/silver original. This an excellent player with a nice low action and a bright ringing sound especially for this pre-Loar period A. It includes a nice original hardshell case with some minor wear but fully solid.

Hardware: Original hardware includes nickel open backed gear-over-worm tuners with grained ivoroid keys, adjustable compensated ebony bridge. Engraved nickel Gibson script tailpiece with 'pineapple' cover.. . Notes: The Gibson 'A' Model was introduced in 1902, with its gently arched body a significant improvement in both tone and comfort over the traditional lute backed Neapolitan mandolin. As the soprano voice in the mandolin orchestras of the day, Gibson's mandolins quickly became the instruments of choice for professional and casual players alike. One of the firm's most popular models, the Style A remained in the Gibson catalog until 1933.. . All carved from solid tonewoods, the instrument features a fine grained spruce soundboard, slab-cut maple body, and a three piece Honduran mahogany neck, with an ebony fingerboard. Simple and elegant in design, the A Model is appointed with grained ivoroid binding and tuner keys, a checkerboard soundhole ring, and a compensated solid ebony bridge. The signature pumpkin finish was hand rubbed in violin style varnish, a color that was changed to a dark brown by 1918, and sprayed in lacquer by 1925.. . Weighing in at a sprightly 1lb 10oz, this featherweight example is brightly resonant and effortless to hold. Interestingly, the 'pineapple' design tailpiece cover is from the earlier Orville Gibson era, and quite a rarity in itself. Maintained in remarkably fine condition, the instrument shows all original finish, tuners and bridge, as well as it's original fitted hardshell case.. . The traditional V profile neck offers smooth low action over it's straight ebony fingerboard, with fine original frets, and a fresh high precision setup. The body is notably free of pick or buckle wear, and apart from an older, soundly resealed hairline crack at the heel, shows no other repairs or restoration. The voice is brilliant and clear, with excellent detail and projection.. . A handsome example, from the era when the mandolin was first in the Gibson catalog, and on the label itself.

But where sheer versatility is concerned, we believe the Northfield NFM-A5 stands apart from the pack and pushes the boundaries of what an A-style can sound like. With a tone that almost seems to change in response to the player and the tune, the A5 can be bright or dark, powerful or delicate, and brassy or mellow depending on what the music calls for. An Engelmann spruce top combines with a figured maple back, neck, and sides for an almost vintage-like openness in all registers, and it's exciting to know that this mandolin will only continue to break in as time goes by. Northfield complete the package visually with a \"Spirit\" varnish finish that lets the figuring in the wood shine through, and subtle touches like cast hardware and the ebony pickguard lend it an understated grace. Included in the price is an Airloom Recurve hard-shell case.","ImageSrc":"https:\/\/www.mandolincafe.com\/classifieds\/upload\/213966.jpg","Ad_Number":"213966","Price1":"$2,795.00","Price2":null},{"Details":"$2,450.00 + shipping. . Gibson A-Junior Snakehead Model Carved Top Mandolin (1925), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 80166, brown stain finish, birch back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingrboard, molded plastic hard shell case.. . This is a great-playing and sounding original A-Junior mandolin from the mid-1920s, just after the \"Loar era\" at Gibson but still embodying many of \"Master Loar's\" ideas. This lovely example of Gibson's mandolin craftsmanship was built in late 1925 (based on the factory order number) but the serial number indicates it was not shipped until about a year later. By that time the company's focus had started shifting primarily to banjos, and mandolin sales were slowing to a crawl.. . \"Snakeheads\" are generally considered the best-sounding roundhole \"A\" style mandolins ever made, revered for their unmatched tone and projection compared to earlier or later A-models. Although the A-Junior was the lowest priced model offered this one certainly bears this out. They are nicknamed for their Loar-designed peghead that angles inward towards the tip, a feature inexplicably abandoned by Gibson a couple of years after this one was made.. . The A-Junior was Gibson's lowest priced carved top mandolin in the 1920's, designed primarily for sale to beginning students. The top and back are still fully carved like the higher priced models, as the instrument was designed to still sound \"Gibsonic\" at the lowest price point. To this end it has no ornament at all but is still built to the same standards as the company's higher end instruments.. . While this basic A-Junior lacks some of the other advanced features of the era (it does not have an adjustable truss rod or height-adjustable bridge) it does sport Loar's slimmer neck profile and sleeker peghead shape. The finish is a clear lacquer coat over an overall brown stain; this is the period when Gibson was switching from varnish to lacquer finishes and the results were sometimes inconsistent. This one is shinier than earlier examples but appears all original, the back and sides may have been polished out at some point but do not appear oversprayed.. . There is no binding at all; the same tortoise celluloid pickguard as the higher grade models is secured by a side bracket still using up the old lever-action clamp. The tailpiece has a simple \"clamshell\" cover plate and the tuners are plain openback strips. Even this most basic \"A\" model is a very fine instrument, with sonic and playing improvements carrying over from \"Master Loar's\" tenure still evident in the later 1920s, and nearly 100 years on making for a very fine sounding (if plain looking) mandolin.. . Overall length is 25 3\/4 in. (65.4 cm.), 10 1\/4 in. (26 cm.) wide, and 1 7\/8 in. (4.8 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 3\/16 in. (30 mm.).. . This close to 100 year old mandolin has seen some use since new, but remains an excellent player with a lively sound. The lacquer-over-varnish finish appears original with some possible polishing out on the back and sides and a few small touchups. The finish overall is still shiny with typical checking to the top and fairly minor dings, dents, and scrapes overall, most notable on the back. There is some wear-through to the unbound edges and more heavily to the wood on the back of the neck. The top remains cleaner than many, largely free of the typical pick wear. There are no visible cracks.. . All hardware remains original and complete including the tuners, tailpiece and pickguard. The neck has remained true for 95 years and the original frets are very clean, probably polished out a bitt but showing hardly any wear. This an excellent example of Gibson's plainest 1920s A Model, cleaner than many and still an excellent players instrument nearly a century on. It is housed in a modern molded HSC...it likely originally came swathed in chipboard.

This 1917 Gibson F2 apparently went back to Gibson in the 1930's. The serial number and factory order number date the mandolin to a build date of 1917. Back then, if you needed work done on your instrument (refret, for example) you sent it back to the factory. Gibson replaced the peghead veneer with one with a straight logo, an adjustable bridge was fitted, a truss rod was added, and a new label with the old serial number and the model name rubber stamped on the label (Gibson used a rubber stamp for the model name on the label in the 1930s onward), and a shaped hardshell case with a pink interior was added. I suppose Gibson could have just replaced the neck on the mandolin, but if they did so it cannot be seen. This is an excellent mandolin upgraded by Gibson to have all of the Loar improvements. The F2 was the next to the top of the line mandolin for Gibson. It has a true red sunburst, spectacular flamy woods on the sides and back, pearl logo, bound top, and a bound ebony fingerboard with treble extension, truss rod in the neck, and an original adjustable bridge. The differences in a F2 and a F4 are cosmetic - the F2 has an unbound back, fingerboard and peghead, and simpler peghead inlay.

Lyon & Healy Style B Model Carved Top Mandolin (1919), made in Chicago, serial # 925, natural top, dark stained back and sides finish, maple back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, original black hard shell case.. . This Washburn Style B Mandolin is one of the elaborate and beautifully crafted \"Own Make\" mandolin family instruments that Lyon & Healy introduced in 1917 -- the only really serious competition Gibson ever faced in the carved-top 8-string market. Lyon & Healy used the finest materials and an original design for these models, although the general concept harks back to Kalamazoo.. . The Chicago company launched this line with a blaze of publicity and claims of superiority, likely alarmed that their dominance of the bowl-back mandolin market had been dramatically undercut by the overwhelming success of the revolutionary Gibsons. Lyon & Healy carved-top mandolins were fairly successful although they never came close to matching Gibson's sales. They continued to be built (both under that brand and subsequently as \"Washburn\") into the Depression years.. . This Style B was the middle instrument in a three-model line and today seems to be the rarest of the trio. It is basically the same design as the top-line Style A but lacks the elaborate scroll peghead, instead using a conventional shape with a carved pediment that looks like it came off a piece of colonial furniture. The 2-point carved tiger maple body and tight-grained spruce top, shaped pickguard, pull-out leg rest and elaborate clamp tailpiece are all signature features shared with its more pricey sister. The 3-piece laminated mahogany neck is fairly chunky with a rounder backed profile than period Gibsons, with a heavy dot-inlaid extended ebony fingerboard.. . The sound of these instruments is more delicate and lighter than most period Gibsons, with a nicely rounded top end and less percussive \"bark\". They have been considered since the 1920s to be the best instruments ever made for classical mandolin playing, but have not been much known or used by old-time or country musicians. We are always impressed by both the sound and craftsmanship of the Lyon & Healy mandolins, and this Style B -- although the middle of the line model -- is still an extremely fine instrument fully equal to a Style A in sound and playability and worthy of any player's or collector's attention.. . Overall length is 25 in. (63.5 cm.), 9 3\/4 in. (24.8 cm.) width, and 1 13\/16 in. (4.6 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 13 1\/2 in. (343 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/8 in. (29 mm.).. . This instrument remains in splendid original condition, with just some very light general wear and discreet repair. The finish shows some tiny dings and dents, but no major wear. The only notable loss to the top finish are some marks under the bridge from it being relocated over time. Oft-missing hardware pieces like the large fibre pickguard, the pull-out peg for seated playing and the elaborate engraved tailpiece cover are present and accounted for.. . Some of the back\/side seams have been neatly resealed, the there is a crack along the rim on the bass side adjacent to the neck block that is very neatly sealed up but not over finished, so visible. There is a visible line on the headstock face where the veneer over the center laminate is stressed but not an open cracks or seam. There are no other cracks or visible repairs.. . This Style B plays extremely well, with a sweet and somewhat lighter sound compared to similar Gibson's. Even with the repairs this is as nice an example of this somewhat rare instrument as we have seen. It is housed in the original shaped hard-shell case in very solid shape with a new handle and the top of the center latch missing. It hardly looks as if 100+ years have passed since this left Chicago, but this little time capsule is an enchanting survivor of the ups and downs of the last century.

Gibson Style DY Army-Navy Special Model Flat Top Mandolin (1919), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, dark brown varnish finish, birch back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, black chipboard case.. . The \"Style DY\" was a short-lived Gibson experiment, the company's first attempt at a very low-cost instrument. Using the general flat-bodied design of the slightly earlier \"Alrite\" model, the \"Army-Navy Special\" dispensed completely with decorative trim and sported a very utilitarian brown finish overall. There was a matching guitar as well (Gibson's first flat-top 6-string), and the initial aim was to sell the plain if functional instruments to Doughboys and sailors at military PX's.. . World War I had pretty much ended by the time production got under way, but the instruments were built for several more years in fairly small numbers. Despite its short shelf life the design was well-remembered; Flatiron company was founded to produce instruments based on this model in 1977.. . Gibson kept the plain-Jane low-cost line alive with the \"Junior\" models introduced after 1919, but the \"A-Jr.\" mandolin was built with a carved top, leaving the flat-top mandolin design to languish until the 1930's. The DY has a unique tone, bright and peppy but with a distinctly Gibson flavor. This is a good-playing and fine sounding example of this fairly rare mandolin.. . Overall length is 24 3\/4 in. (62.9 cm.), 9 3\/4 in. (24.8 cm.) width, and 1 3\/4 in. (4.4 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/8 in. (29 mm.).. . Overall this is a nice if somewhat played in example of this over 100 year old mandolin. There is general wear with some heavier pick marks to the top below the soundhole and dings, scrapes and dents to the finish overall. Several old repairs to the back\/side seams edge are visible in various spots; the birch back often shrinks off the rims on these but everything is solidly glued up. All hardware appears original including the strip tuners, generic \"clamshell\" tailpiece and two-footed compensated ebony bridge. This is a very good sounding and playing \"DY\" with a nice vibe, housed in a later chipboard case.

During this time the mandolin was the most popular stringed instrument, and its light weight, slim profile and sparkling tone was ideal for backpacking and lifting spirits.. . Chuck frequented a local music store called the Back Porch Picking Parlor, owned by Steve Carlson. Steve wanted to stock a well-built and affordable mandolin and Chucks Flatiron nicely fit the bill. Before long, Carlson realized he was selling more than Morrison could produce in a timely manner, so he offered to buy the trademark and the tooling and make them himself. Steve produced a whopping 10,000 Flatiron mandolins, octave mandolins and mandolas between 1980 and 1987 and then decided to sell the business. The Gold Tone Frypan mandolin embodies the spirit and sound of this classic mandolin while maintaining its affordability.. . Our super-affordable, all solid wood 1.8-pound flattie is easy to tote anywhere you want to make music, and the Frypan\u2019s sweet tone and easy playability will please any player. The solid spruce top generates the mandolin\u2019s full tonal range while the solid maple sides and back efficiently reflect and amplify the sound. High-quality components are used throughout its construction: nickel-plated tuners (with attractive striped buttons), mahogany neck with rosewood fingerboard, adjustable 2-way truss rod, rosewood bridge and black ABS bindings, all topped off by a durable gloss finish.

Maurer Model Flat Back, Bent Top Mandolin, made by Larson Brothers (1922), made in Chicago, serial # 28275, natural finish, rosewood back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, black tolex hard shell case.. . From the beginning of the 20th century up until WWII, August and Carl Larson's small Chicago workshop turned out a dizzying assortment of exceptionally well-crafted instruments -- guitars, mandolins, the occasional ukulele, and even harp guitars. The catch is, they never put their name on them. Much of their output was contracted to sell under other brands, but this mandolin bears their own \"Maurer\" house trademark. The brothers had originally been employees in Robert Maurer's Chicago factory but bought him out in 1900, retaining the trade name for their own use. This one additionally has an incised wood block glued to the back under the soundhole noting it was \"Manufactured expressly for S. Ernest Philpitt, Washington DC, Miami, Jacksonville\".. . Regardless of which name they carry Larson flat-back mandolins, mandolas, and mandocellos are beautiful and extremely well-made instruments. The thin but slightly arched straight-braced tops render them more responsive than Gibsons, with a more refined classical sound. Built with ensembles in mind, Larson mandolins have a distinctive and somewhat delicate sound, with less overtone character than the typical Gibson but plenty of volume. A large proportion of Mandolin family instruments were labeled for William Stahl of Milwaukee; this Maurer is a practically identical design. This style is generally similar to the Martin Style A-E, the Weymann Mandolute, and Lyon & Healy's \"Leland Mandos\" which were all products of the early 1910s. Many cheaper mandolins built in Chicago by the likes of Regal and Harmony also hew to this pattern.. . This particular Maurer mandolin is a higher-end model with a lovely Brazilian rosewood body, spruce top, and 5-piece laminated mahogany\/ebony neck. As was the Larsons' custom the top and back are lightly arched, \"Built under tension\" which makes the instrument much sturdier than many similar but flat-topped designs without adding weight. It is very artfully trimmed with celluloid on the top and back edges, with the top ornamented with half-herringbone\/colored wood marquetry trim and a pearl sound hole ring. The bound ebony fingerboard has shaped pearl inlay, while the headstock has a pearl floral pattern and tuners inset from the back. The tailpiece cover and tuner coverplate have neatly incised floral decoration, and the inlaid pickguard has a pearl floral pattern across the center.. . The Larson Brothers' work has become better known in recent years, but their mandolin family instruments lag behind the guitars in appreciation. We feel their version of this type of mandolin is the about the best ever made, and well worthy of attention from more players and collectors. Although very much outside the familiar Gibson realm, this Maurer is a lovely and very fine instrument in its own right with a great history and distinctive character all its own.. . Overall length is 24 1\/2 in. (62.2 cm.), 9 1\/8 in. (23.2 cm.) across at the widest point, and 2 1\/2 in. (6.4 cm.) in depth at side, taken at the end block. Scale length is 13 in. (330 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/8 in. (29 mm.).. . This mandolin is in fine and completely original condition overall, and over a century along remains a very nice-playing and sounding instrument. The finish shows some typical fine checking, with general wear including dings, dents and scrapes here and there, most notably a spot worn to the wood off the back edge of the pickguard. The instrument shows no visible repair and remains in very fine structural condition, with an excellent neck angle and no signs of folding up at all, as many lesser similar period mandolins do. The very small original frets have been polished out showing no subsequent wear. All-in-all an excellent testament to the Larson Brothers' craftsmanship and one of the best of this flat-back, bent-top style mandolins ever designed.

This instrument is not just gorgeous, but it also sounds it, too. If you've never played a top-flight Lyon & Healy mandolin from this period, they're simply a few evolutionary steps ahead of the competition at the time. These elaborate and beautifully made mandolins were the only really serious competition Gibson ever faced in the high-end carved top 8-string market. Using the finest materials and a thoroughly original design, Lyon & Healy created a timeless classic in the Style A. The violin scroll headstock is immediately distinctive, but the 2-point body, shaped pickguard, and clamp tailpiece cover are all signature features. The sound of these instruments is more delicate and lighter than most Gibsons, with a nicely rounded top end and less \"bark\". They have been considered since the 1920's to be the best instruments ever made for classical mandolin playing. I am always impressed by both the sound and craftsmanship of the Lyon & Healy mandolins, and the top of the line Style A is an extremely fine instrument worthy of any player's or collector's attention. This one was made around 1921 in Chicago and has the Lyon and Healy label inside. This mandolin features an assymetrical 2 point body shape, birdseye maple for the back and sides, solid Adirondack spruce top, a 13 inch scale, radiused fretboard, clamp tailpiece with the most amazing cover ever, a vulcanized rubber headstock faceplate and removable floating pickguard, and the most beautiful violin style carved headstock. Frets are good, neck set is good, finish and parts are original. Like 99% of these mandolins, it has a repaired peghead crack. This is a known weak point in the design of the mandolin.

Gibson F-4 Model Carved Top Mandolin (1914), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 24132, sunburst finish, maple back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, brown tolex hard shell case.. . Just about 110 years ago this early two-point F-4 was Gibson's top of the line mandolin and company flagship instrument. This one has seen some use and repair with an old overspray but remains a lovely instrument nonetheless. This mandolin dates to early-mid 1914, a few years after the scroll-body F-4 had been fully perfected from its earlier 3-point body form. In either mode it was an utterly distinctive creation, by almost any standard the finest mandolin in the world in 1914. With a sharper neck angle the mandolins of this period offered more volume and a more powerful tone than earlier Gibsons. This combined with an aggressive sales policy insured the company was able to increasingly dominate the market for mando-family instruments through the 1910s.. . The single layer binding on the body, neck and headstock is grained ivoroid. The double-flowerpot pearl and abalone inlay on the headstock has a particularly dramatic ambered hue. Combined with the inlaid Handel tuner buttons this gives the F-4 a particular Art Nouveau grace and class. The 2-piece maple back has a pronounced flame figure as do the sides. The mahogany neck is fairly slim with a \"V\" profile. This instrument would have been the top choice for any virtuoso mandolinist in the just pre-WWI era, and today is still an iconic creation. This one has seen some adventures over well over a century of use but like a fine old violin is still a wonderful instrument to play.. . Overall length is 26 in. (66 cm.), 10 in. (25.4 cm.) width, and 1 1\/2 in. (3.8 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/4 in. (32 mm.).. . This F-4 shows some wear and repair from over a century on Earth but looks, plays and sounds lovely. There is a very old and thin clear lacquer overspray over the original varnish finish over the entire instrument, which looks to have been done many decades ago. This finish shows noticeable checking along with some random chipping and a collection of mostly minor dings, dents, and scrapes. When the overfinish was done a subtle shading was added to the outer edge of the top, not quite as neatly done as the original hand-rubbed sun burst but not intrusive. There are dings and dents mostly around the perimeter of the top but virtually none of the common pickwear.. . There is a typical scroll repair to the headstock, solidly done but not as neatly as some. A small section of the back center seam looks to have been resealed, as is typical a couple of spots along the upper back\/side seams show signs of re-gluing long ago. There are no cracks to the top or sides.. . The hardware is original and complete including the tuners, multi-saddle bridge and tailpiece and even the oft-missing celluloid pickguard and clamp bracket are still intact. The fingerboard has been trued and refretted with appropriate wire, the original pearl nut is present but slightly lowered. This a very sweet and enjoyable mandolin to play with a sparkling sound and comfortable action. It lives in a modern rectangular HSC.

I\u2019ve played it a fair amount for the last few years, so it\u2019s got a few dings and dents, and since I had built it to keep, the fit and finish are not top notch, but I have cleaned it up, polished it and did a little fret work to it to make it ready to sell.

Frets are fine, neck is straight and the neck set is good. The only difference from the F5 of the period is the unbound peghead, single ply body binding, a simpler peghead logo, no treble extension, and the neck is mahogany instead of maple.

Hardware: Original hardware includes spun aluminum cone with diamond pattern perforated coverplate; nickel 3-on-a-plate tuners; nickel stamped tailpiece. Contoured firestripe pickguard.. . Notes: Introduced in 1929, the National Triolian mandolin was a distinctive member of an extended family of single cone resonator instruments that included the round neck (Spanish) guitar, tenor and plectrum models, and an adorable, and extremely powerful, ukulele. With bodies of rolled steel, these popular priced models were available in two finish options: a sunburst of simulated rosewood grain, and a cheery polychrome finish, some of which were adorned with fanciful stencilled Hawaiian scenes.. . This charming example from the first year of production bears a \"Pat. Applied For\" stamp on the end of its peghead, along with one of the earliest serial numbers known for this model. Maintained in exceptionally fine condition, the instrument retains all original finish, hardware, cone, and coverplate, and is graced with a fetching palm tree seascape on its tan polychrome body, with simulated multi-ply binding painted onto its edges. A period correct suspended firestripe pickguard is the sole addition to this gleaming instrument since it left its Los Angeles factory, just before the stock market nosedived into the Great Depression.. . Remarkably free of pick, buckle or thumbwear, the instrument retains fine original frets on a straight maple fingerboard, with only a bit of wear on its painted position markers. Even its original plush lined rectangular hardshell case remains every bit as pretty as the instrument it's protected for almost a century.. . Needless to say, this metal marvel is not shy, with volume and projection to carry handily from one island to another. But best of all, the thin, hand spun aluminum cone lends the voice a particularly appealing natural reverb, that positively shimmers under the pick. Action is smooth and low with a fresh high precision setup: this tropical treasure is ready to play right out of the case.

Mandolins from this particular time are revered for their beautiful sound, elegant Art Nouveau look and exceptional build quality, the result of 20 years of Gibson perfecting founder Orville's designs. The F-4 Artist's model was Gibson's highest grade mandolin until the advent of the F-hole Master Model F-5 in 1922-3. Even after that $250 model's introduction the F-4 remained priced at $150.00, an extremely expensive and prestigious instrument. The serial number on the label and the Factory order number stamped on the neck block of this mandolin remain clear and date to the first half of 1922, the period just before the F-5 was officially launched.. . This F-4 displays several important new features compared to examples from earlier in the year; this was a time of major advances at Gibson. The elaborate scrolled headstock carries the slanted \"The Gibson\" pearl logo over the original long \"flowerpot\" inlay that is partially covered by the then *brand* new truss rod cover. The mahogany neck has one of the very earliest adjustable truss rods; it retains the reinforcing ebony strip down the center and is slightly slimmer than 1910's examples with a more subtle but still distinct \"V\" profile. The cover itself is made of metal, a short-lived appointment before the plastic version was introduced. The bridge is the then new adjustable ebony style, also introduced not too long before.. . The two-piece back and sides are made of superb flamed maple; despite Gibson's catalog descriptions, only the Style 4 instruments were actually built with the specified maple body. The entire instrument features a beautiful deep hand rubbed sunburst finish with grained ivoroid binding. Other fittings include a raised tortoise celluloid pickguard with a transitional side clamp, engraved tailpiece cover and the tuners are the special open back strips with elongated shafts on the ends and celluloid buttons. A distinctive touch from this period is a genuine pearl nut.. . The venerable F-4 was overshadowed by the new heavily-promoted F-5 after 1923, but examples from the first half of the decade are among the finest ever built and spectacular sounding mandolins. The tone is mellower than Gibson's subsequent F-hole instruments, but with plenty of body and \"bite\" when needed. This instrument would have been the top choice for any virtuoso mandolinist in 1922, and is still an iconic creation. It has some mostly minor scars from over a century of use but like a fine old violin is a wonderful instrument to play.. . Overall length is 26 1\/4 in. (66.7 cm.), 10 in. (25.4 cm.) wide at lower bout, and 1 3\/4 in. (4.4 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 3\/16 in. (30 mm.).. . This mandolin is very clean showing only light wear overall, especially for being just over a century old. The all-original finish shows a lovely patina with only some very minor dings, scratches and dents over the entire instrument. The only oddity is while most of the finish retains excellent color, the entire treble side has faded noticeably from the headstock down to the lower body. Our best guess is the instrument hung for some time where the sun contacted only this area! The back of the neck has some finish worn through the topcoat but no major dings or dents.. . There are no cracks or even any evidence of the typical edge seam repairs. The headstock scroll has never suffered any splitting, which is common with these. All the hardware is original and complete including the tuners, tailpiece, early pattern adjustable ebony bridge, raised celluloid pickguard and mounting bracket.. . The frets appear to be the original thin wire, crowned down slightly and showing very little wear. The pearl nut is original as well. This is a very sweet and enjoyable mandolin to play with a sparkling sound and a most comfortable action, one of the nicest survivors we have had of the eventful century since Gibson's most venerated era for mandolins. It resides in a nice original hard case, with a few old string packets and such for seasoning. Overall Excellent Condition.","ImageSrc":"https:\/\/www.mandolincafe.com\/classifieds\/upload\/213555.jpg","Ad_Number":"213555","Price1":"$250","Price2":"$150.00"},{"Details":"Suggested retail $1,199.00.

It predates Bob\u2019s use of paper labels but it has the serial number 296 penciled on the back and the date 1\/3\/83 penciled under the top. Bob Givens has near-legendary status among today's mandolin builders, as he was one of the first modern luthiers to tackle carved top and back mandolins, including F models, as an individual maker. This example was made long before modern woodworking technology such as CNC revolutionized instrument manufacturing. Givens made all his own jigs and fixtures, cut his own pearl inlays, and essentially built each mandolin solo, or with the occasional help of one other person. Givens has equally high status among players, because his mandolins sound uncommonly good, with a rich, bubbly tone that works well in just about any style of music.. . The nut width on this mandolin is 1 1\/16\u201d and the fretboard is radiused but there is no adjustable truss rod. The previous owner had the frets at the end of the fretboard removed and the fretboard extension scooped, a common modification that makes it easier for the player\u2019s right hand to produce a strong rhythm chop. The maple neck has been given a \"speed neck\" treatment by removing the finish on the barrel of the neck. The bridge appears to be original. The original tuning machines, which were most likely Schallers, were replaced with nickel Gotoh MF-40 gears with pearl buttons. The original tailpiece was replaced with a nickel plated James tailpiece, a definite upgrade. The pickguard is not original but it\u2019s well-made in the Gibson style. There are a pair of nicely repaired cracks at the top and bottom of the treble-side f-hole, and a repaired crack in the top near the curl. The finish has quite a few nicks, scuffs and dings and shows the signs of having been played a bunch. That makes sense because this instrument has the kind of tone and easy-to-get volume that makes it hard to put down once you start playing. Includes a hardshell case.. . $7,250.00. . UPC 141222.

Gibson F-4 with Virzi Model Carved Top Mandolin (1917), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 11068 (FON), sunburst lacquer finish, maple back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, black tolex hard shell case.. . This is a very interesting example of an early Gibson mandolin that almost certainly was returned to the factory for work more than once in the decades after it was originally made, a not too uncommon situation. The instrument is an F-4 originally built in 1917, confirmed by the factory order number (FON) stamped on the neck block; the serial number on the label is too obscured to read clearly. Sometime in the early 1920s (probably around 1923-4) it had a Virzi tone producer installed and a second label added with Virzi serial number #10718. This was a Gibson factory service job at the time, something Lloyd Loar personally advocated. As this entailed removing the back, it was probably at least partially refinished at this time. Sometime later (probably around 1960) it was returned to Gibson for service again, refretted and refinished with contemporary sunburst lacquer.. . The F-4 was Gibson's top of the line mandolin at the time this one was made and the company flagship in the 1910's. The scroll-body instrument had been fully perfected from its early 3-point body form and was an utterly distinctive creation, almost certainly the finest mandolin in the world in 1917. Many of these were the personal instruments of professional players, Gibson teacher-agents or their best pupils; at a price of $150.00 the f-4 was an extremely expensive and prestigious instrument. It would have been the top choice for practically any virtuoso mandolinist in the WWI era.. . Under its later-style sunburst finish this F-4 has typical features for the late 1910s. The one-piece maple back has a discreet but noticeable flame figure; the F-4 was the only Gibson mandolin in 1917 actually made of maple as the catalogs specified. All binding is grained ivoroid, and with the double-flowerpot pearl and abalone inlay on the headstock the F-4 exudes a particular Art Nouveau grace and class. The Handel tuners are period but lack the inlaid buttons usually seen in 1917; they may have been replaced by Gibson when the Virzi was added.. . The Virzi \"Tone Producer\" is actually a thin spruce disc suspended under the top. Produced by the Virzi Bros. violin company in New York it was championed by Loar and offered by Gibson as an optional (and extra cost) feature. The Virzi was usually installed in Loar's pet Master Model instruments; it is relatively uncommon in a round hole mandolin. A small number of \"Virzi F-4's\" are known to exist, and this retrofitted example is particularly unusual. The \"Tone Producer\" was intended to add extra harmonic partials to the sound; many players have been disappointed that it does not actually assist volume. What it does do is help produce a more complex sound with richer overtones; that is the theory anyway! Some have been removed by players who want a louder more driving tone, but those that remain are a fascinating part of the Loar era story.. . The F-4 Artist's model was Gibson's highest grade mandolin until the advent of the Master Model F-5 in 1922, and even after that model's introduction remained an important part of the company's line. The owner of this one seems to have treasured their instrument and had it kept up to date by the Factory over decades; perhaps they even knew Master Loar and had the Virzi installed at his suggestion! Whatever its story this mandolin's journey through different eras of Gibson history have given it a unique character.. . Overall length is 26 in. (66 cm.), 9 7\/8 in. (25.1 cm.) wide, and 1 9\/16 in. (4 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/8 in. (29 mm.).. . This is a sweet sounding old F-4, with a unique mix of features from across the decades. The vibrant sunburst lacquer finish as noted appears to date to the late '50s or early 1960s; it is definitely Gibson factory work. There has been some subsequent wear, with light pick marks here and there and some minor checking to the top. The back of the neck has a bit of playwear in the lower positions and some chipping near the heel. Other than that there is not a lot of wear.. . There is an old typical scroll repair on the headstock, which is very inconspicuous may have been fixed in the 1920s by the look of it. Apart from one small back\/side seam bulge above the tailpiece there are no other structural repairs. The fingerboard appears to have been refretted and rebound when the refinish was done. The oft-missing celluloid pickguard is gone, the original tailpiece is intact and the tuners are period if possibly not the first original set. The bridge is a more recent adjustable 1920s style. This \"hybrid\" F-4 is very good player, with a very comfortable action and a nice singing tone, somewhat mellower than the typical f-hole mandolin, but with plenty of body and \"bite\" when needed. This is a neat playable piece of Gibson mandolin history, housed in a later HSC.

F. Martin Style 20 Model Carved Top Mandolin (1931), made in Nazareth, PA, serial # 15241, natural lacquer finish, flame maple back and sides, spruce top; maple neck with ebony fingerboard, black tolex hard shell case.. . This is a fine playing example of a cool early 1930's Martin rarity, the Style 20 Mandolin. Martin's carved top mandolins are generally overlooked instruments many players are not even aware of, but like all products of Nazareth they are beautifully made and have their own charms. This model is one of the less commonly seen ones, but a cool piece of history in a couple of ways.. . During the 1930s C.F. Martin offered several styles of oval and later F-hole carved-top mandolins of which the Style 20 was the earliest and arguably the best. The model first appeared in 1929 but production never again equaled the 101 shipped that first year, likely because the depression immediately killed off most of the mandolin market. Still it was not officially discontinued until WWII, but a total of only 232 were ever produced. 40 of these (this one included) were sold in 1931 with a list price was $75 (Without case) which oddly never changed over the life of the instrument.. . The Style 20 is not Martin's most original design; it is heavily \"inspired\" by the 1910s Lyon & Healy Style B. Like that instrument it is built with a carved curly maple back and arched carved spruce top, but with a sharper neck angle than the L&H or indeed most Gibsons. The bridge is a non-adjustable ebony piece, the tailpiece a standard clamshell type with an engraved cover and the tuners are openback engraved Waverly strips. The mahogany neck has a fairly slim but deep rounded profile with a bound, dot-inlaid ebony fingerboard and rosewood headstock veneer. The crown of the headstock has a decorative cutout borrowed from Vinaccia style Neapolitan bowlback mandolins.. . This is a fine sounding and very good playing mandolin, albeit with a shorter scale and different feel from the average Gibson. Its more delicate but well rounded tone records beautifully and can be useful for a number of musical styles. While this is a fairly obscure instrument it boasts one important historic signature user: Earle Bolick of the Blue Sky Boys played an early Style 20 for pretty much the brother duet's entire career. All of their very influential recordings were made with this style instrument, and clearly feature its distinctive tone.. . Overall length is 25 in. (63.5 cm.), 10 1\/4 in. (26 cm.) across at the widest point, and 1 13\/16 in. (4.6 cm.) in depth at side, taken at the end block. Scale length is 13 in. (330 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/8 in. (29 mm.).. . This 90+ year old Martin remains in excellent playing condition with some general wear and tear. The all-original finish has the heaviest checking and weathering to the top, with some notable touch up to the top edge of the soundhole rim, probably from pick wear. The top finish also shows some fairly random dings, dents and scrapes, but the finish on the back, sides and neck is much cleaner.

Gibson Style J *LOCAL PICKUP ONLY* Model Mando Bass (1920), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 64141, brown varnish finish, birch back and sides, spruce top, mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard.. . The Style J Mando-Bass is one of the original Gibson company's most picturesque creations, always a conversation piece if not always a truly functional instrument. It was introduced in 1912 to round out the bottom end of the company's mandolin orchestra line, and made in very limited quantities up into the late 1920s. It survived in the Gibson catalog nearly up into WWII, although by that time it was likely just a desperate effort to clear whatever old stock was cluttering up the factory.. . This is quite a large instrument, although somewhat smaller overall than a standard 3\/4 upright bass. The carved spruce top has a round soundhole, arching over a somewhat bulbous birch body. The mahogany neck is carved in a thick \"V\" profile, topped by a fretted ebony fingerboard inlaid with pearl dots. The instrument was designed to be played either seated or standing, with a large spike retracting into the treble side to assist with the former position. Using a leather pick was the suggested playing method.. . Gibson called the Style J \"The instrument that is so much that all praise falls behind it\". In 1918 the price was $95.85 including a canvas cover; for reasons easily apparent Gibson never offered a real case for it. \" the deep, profound pulsations of the mando-bass are the heart and soul of true rhythm\" Gibson noted in 1929, adding \"The mando-bass is often featured for solos and \"Hot Breaks\" in the orchestra\". That's something we'd still like to see! If nothing else the Style J remains a conversation piece par excellence, a truly colorful part of Gibson history.. . Overall length is 64 in. (162.6 cm.), 24 1\/4 in. (61.6 cm.) across at the widest point, and 6 3\/8 in. (16.2 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 42 1\/4 in. (1073 mm.).. . This instrument is in structurally solid shape; we would describe it as playable, but not a joy to play! The neck has enough forward bow to make fretting something of a chore, even for a player accustomed to upright bass action. The frets are in good shape, anyway, and the fingerboard shows some light work. The original finish has numerous dings, dents, scrapes and chips overall but no really heavy wear.. . There are some resealed seams on the body edges, small sealed cracks in the rim on both sides and one large sealed grain split to the top with some visible touch up. The instrument is completely solid, with the caveat that the neck is not straight. The tuners and tailpiece are original, as is the side extension peg. The carved maple bridge is old, but not original and the \"arm bar\" that once arched over the top is long gone. We would describe this as primarily a display piece, which can be played for demonstration or novelty effect but is not a professionally playable instrument. This Style J sat next to the piano in a Midwest home for the better part of the last century; there is no case or bag.

Gibson Style A Model Carved Top Mandolin (1922), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 67097, Sheraton brown top, dark stained back and sides finish, birch body, spruce top, mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, black tolex hard shell case.. . This is a very fine just 100+ year old example of the \"early Loar era\" Gibson Style A Mandolin, still in excellent original condition a century on. This one was made in mid\/late 1921, and shipped out early in 1922. The typical period features include the dark but very thin \"Sheraton Brown\" varnish finish top, a raised celluloid pickguard and the standard Gibson-engraved tailpiece. The most interesting piece of hardware is the very first version of Gibson's new adjustable bridge with the short-lived aluminum saddle. The top is spruce with a lovely straight even grain, the back and sides birch and the neck Honduras mahogany with a heavy ebony fingerboard.. . The Style A was the company's base-line carved-top mandolin, still with all the sound quality of \"the Gibson\" (as it was advertised at the time) without much in the way of decoration beyond a bound top and 3-ply soundhole ring. The \"browntop\" mandolins of the late 'teens and early 1920's may not be the prettiest of the old \"paddlehead\" Gibsons but they are often the best sounding. This one is an excellent centennial survivor, a very playable mandolin with a very low, comfortable action and powerful, ringing tone with more sustain than most, likely courtesy of the solid aluminum saddle. It remains 100 years on an enduring testament to the exceptional work of the original Kalamazoo, Michigan Gibson factory.. . Overall length is 26 1\/2 in. (67.3 cm.), 10 1\/16 in. (25.6 cm.) wide, and 1 7\/8 in. (4.8 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 3\/16 in. (30 mm.).. . This mandolin shows some general wear and finish checking (it is 100 years old, after all!) but remains clean for its age, all original and an excellent players instrument. The finish has a some dents, dings and scratches mostly to the top, where there are some scars around the bridge base where it looks like perhaps it was once stored with the bridge laying flat. There are no areas of loss down to the wood except spots on either side of the nut on the back of the neck.. . All the seams are solid and there are no cracks or repairs visible. The original thin varnish has not been overfinished and all hardware remain original and complete including the tuners, tailpiece with engraved cover, the oft-missing elevated pickguard and that rare first-generation adjustable bridge. The original frets have some minor wear but are still quite playable and this is a very nice playing and sounding mandolin, a lovely centennial survivor.

Northfield's \"Big Mon\" is of course named after the famous Bill Monroe tun, and like his iconic Lloyd Loar F-5 it has the black-white purfling lines on the sides (instead of on the top and back). But you don't have play like Monroe to get what this model is about, that becomes clear with just few chord chops and quick runs with your flat pick. It's hard to believe this is a brand new mandolin, and when those brassy-sounding new strings are broken in a bit the tone will be even more convincing. Note that this example, with the \"WN\" suffix to the model code, has a slightly wider neck. We've found that even the most die-hard bluegrass pickers rarely object to that extra 1\/16\" at the nut, instead just noticing that the fingers of their left hand have a bit more room.. . Northfield pulled out all the stops for this model, even giving it a hybrid varnish finish instead of straight nitrocellulose lacquer. Thankfully it's also not a slavish copy of Monroe's mandolin, or of any Gibson mandolin for that matter. The list of little differences goes on and on, such as the pearl dots on the fingerboard being graduated in size, and the delicate headstock inlay bears little resemblance to the classic \"flower pot\" inlay found on all those Gibsons. The finish has a satin sheen, and the back of the neck has the look of a carefully worn fiddle neck. In a nod to function for the contemporary player, the fingerboard extension is shortened and slightly scooped, giving your flatpick better access to that \"sweet spot\" just past the 20th fret where an F-hole mandolin yields the warmest, most bubbly, tone. You won't be picking in that spot when you try to capture Monroe's tone on \"Big Mon,\" but when backing vocals the singer(s) will appreciate the different tone you get by picking that far away from the bridge.. .

Classic F5 mandolin construction with a red spruce top and Big Leaf maple neck, back and rim. The maple of the rim is of a tight ribbon flame pattern, the one-piece neck has a wider diagonal flame pattern, and the two-piece back of somewhat irregular flame bordering on a quilted pattern. The varnish finish is of a classic \u201cCremona\u201d brown shading in the 1920s Gibson tradition. This tradition is carried on in the build and tonal response of the instrument, with this mandolin easily designated as having a \u201cLoar flavored\u201d sound. This instrument has been regularly used by a full-time professional musician since 2007, and the finish on the top exhibits an ample collection of pick-stroke marks, a small spot of finger-contact wear through the finish, some mic contact marks around the treble-side f-hole and some wear and marks where one\u2019s right forearm contacts the edge of the top. The only other wear is found in two small areas on the neck, adjacent to either edge of the fretboard. The mandolin received a refret, radiusing of the fretboard and scalloping of the extension by former Gibson mandolin luthier Danny Roberts at the end of 2023. As a result of this work and his impeccable set-up, the mandolin now plays and responds as well as it ever has in my time of ownership. One former owner of this mandolin was journalist\/musician Steven Stone and his review of the instrument can be read here: https:\/\/www.vintagemandolin.com\/vg_article05stanley_7.html.

Fender Solid Body Electric Mandolin (1973), made in Fullerton, California, serial # 02748, sunburst polyester finish, alder body, maple neck with rosewood fingerboard, original black tolex hard shell case.. . One of Leo Fender's more obscure instrument creations, the solidbody Electric Mandolin was in production from 1957 into the 1970's but is a relatively rare item in any era. This is a VERY late example, probably assembled in 1973 when the model was practically extinct; it was officially discontinued in 1976. This one shows some signs of use but remains in nearly all-original condition, with one pot replaced.. . This mandolin was likely assembled in early-mid 1973 (the tone pot is coded 7304) but the neck has a red-coded date stamp suggesting it was fabricated in 1969. With extremely limited production in the CBS era a mandolin neck held in stock for some time before being assembled into a complete instrument is not unusual. Most extant examples date to the 1950s; later \"Mandocasters\" are rare items from any year, likely only assembled when an order came in.. . The Fender Mandolin differs from most other electrics (and all acoustic mandolins) in having only four strings instead of the usual doubled courses. This follows the ideas of the mostly western swing players who were instrumental in helping develop Fender instruments, and is also sometimes seen in Bigsby electric mandolins. This results in a clearer more brilliant electric sound without the natural \"chorusing\" effect of doubled strings, albeit one that sounds as much like an octave guitar as a mandolin.. . This instrument is also just ridiculously cute, resembling more than anything else a \"just hatched\" baby Precision Bass. All the regular Fender features are there in miniature, including a pearl dot rosewood fingerboard on a maple neck with the classic Fender headstock, 3-tone sunburst finish on an alder body, tortoise celluloid pickguard and brown plastic-covered single coil pickup, which in this case looks like it may have been in stock for years already. The tuners are double line plastic-button strip Klusons. The late '60s style script Fender logo decal has no model name; \"Mandocaster\" is the collectors' slang for these but Fender just called it the Electric Mandolin. The black Tolex Fender-logo case is also a miniature version of the standard guitar case and is kind of adorable as well.. . Overall length is 25 7\/8 in. (65.7 cm.), 10 1\/16 in. (25.6 cm.) wide at lower bout, and 1 5\/8 in. (4.1 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 13 3\/4 in. (349 mm.). Width of nut is 1 3\/16 in. (30 mm.).. . This is a nicely original instrument overall showing some minor wear with a fairly recently replaced volume pot as the only alteration. The original sunburst finish is lightly faded, not as bright as the '60s models but still quite attractive. The body has a collection of fairly random dings, scuffs and dents, mostly on the top and back. The pickguard has some minor shrinkage but no split or popped corners, with some minor scuffing on the face.. . The instrument is all original except the volume pot and some attendant wiring, even retaining the chromed snap-on bridge cover. The frets and fingerboard remain in excellent condition with very little wear and this is a very fine playing and sounding Fender Mandolin, in a nice original black Tolex HSC with the never-used original cord, polish cloth and CBS era warranty card.

A century later, the F-5 still stands as the epitome of mandolin excellence, revered for its impeccable tone, effortless playability, and stunning aesthetics. To recreate this iconic instrument, Gibson delved into their vault and meticulously studied renowned mandolins, including the iconic July 9th, 1923 Bill Monroe mandolin, using advanced scientific analysis, precise 3D scanning, and detailed notes from Lloyd Loar. The result is a masterpiece painstakingly hand-built and refined by the artisans at the Gibson Custom Shop, ensuring every detail - from the look to the sound and feel - remains true to Loar's original vision.. . The heart of this reissue masterpiece lies in its meticulously crafted features. The mandolin boasts a hard-carved Red Spruce top, a material known for its ability to impart intense energy and projection to the sound, allowing every note to resonate with clarity and richness. Complementing this is a 2-piece Quarter Sawn Figured Red Maple back, not only enhancing the aesthetics with its exquisite grain but also fortifying the mandolin against surface checking and warping for lasting durability.

This Gibson A-1 was built in Kalamazoo in 1915, so it\u2019s celebrating its108th birthday this year. Happily, it has survived in remarkably good and original condition and still has its original tuners, pickguard, and tailpiece with the engraved cover. The original frets are worn but they are playable. The bridge has been replaced with one that has been made in the original style but with saddle inserts to help improve intonation. The neck is straight, the action is low, and it delivers the round, bubbly tone that made these mandolins popular in 1915, and every year since then.

Harmony H-835 Model Hollow Body Electric Mandolin (1972), made in Chicago, serial # 6201H35, sunburst lacquer finish, maple body and neck, spruce top, rosewood fingerboard, black tolex hard shell case.. . This is unusual and rather fancily styled electric mandolin dates to the waning days of the illustrious Harmony company. The H-35 was a very distinctive model, instantly recognizable with a single-bound scooped double cutaway body sporting an extended upper horn and eccentrically shaped sound holes. The maple neck has a bound, block inlaid rosewood fingerboard and a headstock shape mirroring the body profile. The Harmony logos on the headstock and pickguard were made by etching through the black top layer of plastic tom the whiter beneath, a somewhat old-fashioned method even at the time.. . The now much celebrated DeArmond \"Golden Tone\" pickup is centrally mounted on the body with tone and volume controls on the lower bout. This unit gives the H-35 quite a powerful electric sound, without either the muddiness or overly shrill character that sometimes plagues amplified 8-strings. The sound can be effectively dialed back for a more acoustic-y character, or played flat-out with a nice bite.. . This H-35 has an S-72 factory code indicating manufacture in 1972. It was one of the best electric mandolins of the time although to be fair, there weren't a lot of other choices in the 1970s. It was the favored instrument of Blues mandolin legend Yank Rachell in the later stages of his career and can be seen in numerous pictures of him. For blues or beyond this is an excellent playing and sounding example of this cool and funky 8-string, a classic in its own right if an admittedly relatively obscure one!. . Overall length is 27 3\/8 in. (69.5 cm.), 10 1\/4 in. (26 cm.) wide at lower bout, and 1 3\/4 in. (4.4 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/4 in. (32 mm.).. . This now 50+ year old Harmony is quite clean overall and all original. The finish shows just some very light handling wear, with some rubbed away spots on the bass side of the headstock but no other real noticeable wear. The hardware is also quite clean; The sliding bridge cover is slightly bent up and these is some minor scuffing to the pickguard. This H-35 is about the nicest one we have had, with a better-then-average straight neck and just-polished out frets making for a good playing and excellent sounding example. It resides in a later Epiphone-branded HSC.

Gibson C-1 Model Flat Top Mandolin (1932), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 257 (FON), natural lacquer finish, mahogany back, sides and neck, spruce top, black tolex hard shell case.. . The rare C-1 mandolin is a cool Gibson obscurity, the direct depression-era descendant of the earlier Style D \"Alrite\" and \"DY-Army\/Navy\" mandolins that were Gibson's very first attempts at flat-topped instruments. Gibson's entire marketing strategy was originally built around the superiority of their arched-top designs, so the company had to tread carefully when opening up this new area! The C-1 was a later iteration of this design, conceived early in the depression when the company desperately needed to offer instruments at the lowest possible price points.. . The C-1 (a name not fitting into any known Gibson nomenclature) re-used the oval, flat-bodied design of those1910s \"Alrite\" models, with a slightly altered silhouette to better fit the standard arch-top mandolin neck. The flat top has no pickguard (although the catalog pictured one) and a simple non-adjustable bridge, a lower cost \"clamshell\" tailpiece. The top is natural finished spruce, bound on the top edge with a 3-ply soundhole ring. The back and sides are mahogany, the neck is mahogany with an ebony fingerboard topped by a 1920's style Gibson headstock with the '30s white script logo and basic unplated tuner strips.. . Gibson seemed somewhat ambivalent about the idea from the beginning. The design had originally been shown as an off-brand \"Kel Kroydon\" logo instrument, but emerged as a full-branded Gibson in 1931. The C-1 has a distinctive warm sound, but had a very short shelf life. Introduced in 1931 at a price of $25.00, it was out of the catalog after 1932 and examples are rarely seen today. This is kind of a shame as although built to a price this is a fun instrument to play and better sounding than one might expect. This is the only one of these we have seen and a neat very playable piece of Gibson history.. . Overall length is 26 in. (66 cm.), 10 1\/4 in. (26 cm.) across at the widest point, and 2 1\/16 in. (5.2 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/8 in. (29 mm.).. . Overall this is a fairly clean and all original mandolin, showing some general wear but structurally excellent and a very nice player. The all original finish light checking and some random dings, dents and scrapes. There is a patch of pickwear to the top and some rubbing and chips mostly to the unbound back edge. The instrument plays very well and has a lively sound, rather different from the common carved top Gibson with more warmth and depth than most flatback mandolins. This neat Gibson rarity is fairly unique in sound and feel and a lot of fun to play; it rests in a later HSC.

Today, the Mando-Lute is considered a rare and unique instrument that is highly sought after by collectors and musicians alike.. . One of the unique features of the Weymann Mando-Lute was the use of a lightweight, arched back made of laminated spruce and mahogany. This innovative construction method helped to give the Mando-Lute a bright, clear tone and a rich sustain. Many people enjoy these instruments for playing Celtic music.. .

Kalamazoo KM-22 Model Arch Top Mandolin (1939), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, sunburst top, dark back and sides finish, laminated maple back and sides, spruce top, mahagony neck, black tolex hard shell case.. . The KM-22 was the fancier of two arch top F-hole mandolin models Gibson offered their Depression-era customers under the budget-oriented Kalamazoo brand. This model looks more like a Gibson than many of these, bur still sold for the low, low price of low $21.50 in 1939 (plus $4 for the case) making it one of the least expensive instruments the company ever offered. For all that it is quite attractive and functional, a very playable F-hole, arched top mandolin more affordable than any Gibson-branded model.. . This economy could be achieved because the KM-12's top and back are \"Arco-Arched\", Gibson's term for wood pressed into shape instead of carved. The solid spruce top is heavily X-braced and reinforced from the underside, while the mahogany back has one sturdy cross brace straight across the middle for support. The finish is dark mahogany with an attractive sunburst on the top, more Gibson-like in appearance than many Kalamazoos. The top and back edges are bound in ivory Celluloid, as is the fingerboard. The fittings are typical Gibson, with an elevated pickguard made of bound tortoise Celluloid, a rosewood adjustable bridge, generic \"clamshell\" tailpiece and surprisingly nice Kluson strip tuners.. . This is an excellent playing mandolin and sounds quite good, with a tone surprisingly close to Gibson's own F-hole models of the period. While lacking a carved top or adjustable truss rod, it is still built to Gibson's quality standards out of the same materials as the full-line instruments. It may be one of the best bargains Gibson offered in a depression-era mandolin, and remains so today!. . Overall length is 25 3\/4 in. (65.4 cm.), 10 1\/4 in. (26 cm.) wide, and 2 3\/16 in. (5.6 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/4 in. (32 mm.).. . This mandolin is in very nice original condition, complete and unaltered with some general wear overall. The original lacquer finish shows typical checking, scuffs, dings, and dents, with the majority of the scuffing and scratching on the back some of which has light touch up. There is a patched spot on treble side of the heel where it looks like a strap button was removed.. . The top has a well repaired grain split just above the fingerboard extension, solidly sealed but visible, and a small split near the top edge over the kerfing. The center of the top shows a just a little bit of sinkage under the bass side of the bridge; many of these have a lot more deflection in this zone. We checked it over and the instrument is completely solid and actually a very good little player.. . All the original hardware is intact including the Kluson strip tuners, original bridge, pickguard, and even the tailpiece cover, so often lost along the way. Overall this is a good-playing example of this 1930s Gibson-made instrument, the better grade of Kalamazoo and a good-sounding authentic pre-war mandolin that remains a bargain, just like it was 80+ years ago.

Asking $6000 obo. I played the mandolin in the live setting from 2010-2015 and have taken extremely good care of it. After 2015 it was lightly played. It currently has two pickups(a primary and secondary). The primary is the coveted and discontinued baggs bridge pickup which is what Sam bush, drew emmitt and Jeff Austin played(among many others). The second pickup is a K and K and is installed internally. The port is setup to run one of the pickups or both(ring\/tip) for a stereo mix. I typically would run both pickups simultaneously(even if stereo wasn\u2019t an option) and blend them together. I truly believe it\u2019s one of the best sounding setups my ears have heard. Great high end for soloing but the chop is unreal. The bags on its own sounds awesome and the k and k on its own sounds awesome. Both for different reasons but when they are paired it\u2019s incredible. The mandolin just spent the last week with Bobby being tuned up and he made some slight tweaks. It\u2019s playing better than ever. I also have a calton case(pictured) which retail above 1k. I think the stickers are cool but will remove them if desired. Let me know if you have any questions for me. I really don\u2019t want to sell it but life happens. Would love for it to go to a good home.. . Condition is great.

Vivi-Tone Hollow Body Electric Mandolin (1933), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 301, brown sunburst lacquer finish, spruce top and back, birch ply sides; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, original black chipboard case.. . This extremely rare Vivi-Tone electric mandolin is a superb example of Lloyd Loar's pioneering efforts in the creation of electric fretted instruments, as well as one of the earliest electric mandolins ever made, predated only by the virtually non-existent 1929 Stromberg-Voisinet electrics. Loar himself played primarily mandolin family instruments, so it seems likely this was a project he had more personal interest in at Vivi-Tone.. . Loar and Williams both left Gibson over 1923-4. In the early 1930s Williams was bullish on the future of amplification, and Loar joined him by 1932 in launching the Vivi-Tone operation, initially to market radical solid \"plank\" bodied amplified instruments. As sales were minimal they quickly re-tooled their instruments to be capable of both acoustic and amplified sound hoping to appeal to more conservative players (maybe!). This mandolin actually has a decent amount of volume not plugged in.. . This is a very well-made and playable mandolin embodying the unusual fruits of Loar's acoustic theories, even beyond the fascinatingly engineered if somewhat primitive pickup. This radical instrument almost turns the mandolin inside out; the thin arched solid spruce BACK is the soundboard as much as the heavy flat spruce top. The teardrop-shaped body has a subtle sunburst finish and heavy laminated rims, designed to prevent vibration with the back is recessed into them to avoid contact with the player. The only soundhole in the top is under the bridge, while the back carries two small f-holes.. . The soft \"V\" mahogany neck has a Gibson-like feel with a bound ebony fingerboard and pearl dot inlay. The headstock shape is similar to the Loar-era \"snakehead\" Gibsons, ivoroid veneered on the face with a screened \"Vivi-Tone\" logo. The engraved Waverly strip tuners have grained ivoroid buttons. The top is triple bound, the heelcap is ivoroid. The cast tailpiece carries a very Art Nouveau \"Vivi-Tone\" logo; the pickguard is heavy tortoise celluloid raised above the rim. The substantial maple bridge has a compensated ebony cap.. . The pickup is enclosed in a removable drawer which slides out of the bass side of the rim. Loar's design is a hybrid magnetic\/electrostatic type with string vibration transmitted through the wooden bridge by two long screws to a metal plate atop a magnetic coil. This is not as efficient as the string-through horseshoe magnet design pioneered by Rickenbacker at the same time, but is functional. A jack is now mounted on the outside of the drawer; originally there was a hard-wired cloth cable.. . The underside of this internal assembly is labeled \"Vivi Tone Mandolin, Patent Applied For No. 301 Manufactured by Vivi Tone Company Kalamazoo, Michigan\". An additional ink stamp on wood reads \"Vivi-Tone Company 71 West 23th Street Suite 1520 Masonic Hall New York City Gramercy 5-2879\". Phone calls to that number have failed to rouse comment from Lloyd's ghost. Interestingly Gibson's New York sales office was in the same building at that time; perhaps relations were more cordial than history records between them and their prodigal sons. At any rate his is a unique and playable piece of history, one of the rarest and flat-out coolest of all electric mandos.. . Overall length is 27 in. (68.6 cm.), 9 1\/2 in. (24.1 cm.) wide at lower bout, and 2 3\/4 in. (7 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 7\/8 in. (378 mm.).. . This very rare instrument remains in generally excellent original and fully playable condition. The original finish shows light scratching, dings and dents overall, with some small ancient touch ups to a few dings on the top. There is a short repaired center grain crack in the top just behind the bridge, solid but visible, and a small lamination split on the headstock by the bass side tuners. There is a heavy plastic plate surrounding the phone jack that is not original; this replaced a hard-wired cord long ago.. . The frets are in excellent shape, and the mandolin plays very well. The amplified sound is fairly low volume but pleasant enough, with more of an acoustic character than most later electric mandolins. The instrument still lives in its original heavy chipboard case, now 90 years old and looking futuristic and antique in equal measure. Overall Excellent - Condition.","ImageSrc":"https:\/\/www.mandolincafe.com\/classifieds\/upload\/212838.jpg","Ad_Number":"212838","Price1":"$6,500.00","Price2":null},{"Details":"Suggested retail $1,199.00.

Gibson A-4 Model Carved Top Mandolin (1928), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 84005, red sunburst top, dark stained back and sides finish, maple back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, original black hard shell case.. . This is an interesting and fairly rare Gibson mandolin; a Style A-4 from the late 1920s. The long-running model was phased out of production in the early 1930s but even at this point relatively few of this top model in the A-style line. The A-4 was Gibson's highest priced non-scroll mandolin for much of the company's early history, but mandolins in general were in decline by the end of the 1920s and Gibson was building very few compared to the 1910s glory days -- especially of these more expensive models.. . This A-4 was built towards the end of 1928 and likely shipped right at the beginning of 1929. It is generally similar to earlier examples, but equipped with all the newer 1920s features carried forward from the \"Loar Era\" including the adjustable truss rod in the neck, adjustable ebony bridge and \"modern\" metal rod pickguard bracket. It still carries the model's trademark pearl fleur-de-lis and Gibson logo on the headstock.. . The round-profile neck is just a bit thicker and chunkier feeling than the 1920s \"snakehead\" examples made during Lloyd Loar's tenure, but has a very comfortable feel compared to the \"V\" profile of the 1910s. The dark red sunburst top has a very deep hue, and this is still a very classy-looking mandolin. Rather less common than its 1910s or '20s ancestors, this late model A-4 is a lovely and very fine-sounding instrument.. . Overall length is 26 in. (66 cm.), 10 1\/4 in. (26 cm.) width, and 1 7\/8 in. (4.8 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 3\/16 in. (30 mm.).. . Overall this is a nicely preserved and very good-playing mandolin, showing some light play wear and minor repair. The all-original finish still shines like it did before the Stock Market crash with light checking and some minor dings, dents and scratches, most notably a few random pick marks to the top.. . There is one repair, to a spruce grain crack running behind the bridge under the strings, nearly invisible as it is very cleanly sealed with no overfinish. The instrument shows no other cracks or even seam repairs. All hardware is original and complete in very good condition. The frets have been recently crowned and show no show some light wear but the mandolin plays quite nicely with a powerful and even tone. The original HSC is present in nicely preserved shape as well.

Gibson F-5 Model Carved Top Mandolin (1955), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # A-21802, sunburst lacquer finish, maple back and sides, spruce top; maple neck with ebony fingerboard, original brown tolex hard shell case.. . The F-5 has always been Gibson's top-of-the-line mandolin and the standard by which all others are judged, in bluegrass and related circles anyway. This F-5 dates to the mid-1950s and while less well regarded in retrospect than pre-WWII examples is still a beautiful and very high quality instrument. At the it one was made interest in the mandolin was picking up again after a long layoff, mostly due to the popularity of Bill Monroe and his emerging disciples. While Bluegrass as a genre was still gestating, bands who closely emulated Monroe's sound needed a mandolin, and the one they ultimately wanted was an F-5.. . After a layoff since the war years, the F-5 had re-appeared in Gibson's line at the dawn of the 1950s. This example was shipped in December 1955, possibly the last of a grand total of 16 sold that year. One of the reasons for this miniscule production was the price; a new F-5 listed in 1952 for $415, raised in 1956 to $460. in the 1950s that was a LOT of money for any mandolin, and at the time old Gibsons from the 1910s and '20s were fairly plentiful on the used market. Many thousands of the lesser models survived, but vintage F-5's were ALWAYS rare. Still, an F-5 was the ultimate goal for any aspiring bluegrasser (and still some more classically oriented players) and there was nothing else comparable available new from ANY manufacturer.. . The 1950s version retained the classic asymmetrical body with an upper scroll, two points on the treble side and f-holes. A sunburst finish graces all surfaces. The top, back and headstock are triple bound; the three-piece maple neck has an ebony fretboard single-bound with a side stripe. There are pearl block inlays from the first fret, and treble side extension with a total of 29 frets raised above the body. The laminated beveled edge pickguard has a gold-plated support, the gold-plated tailpiece cover is the simpler clamshell design with the Gibson logo engraved.. . The headstock retains the classic Style 5 abalone \"flower pot\" inlay under the post-war Gibson logo with an open \"b\" and \"o\". inlaid in peghead. The gold-plated \"no logo\" Deluxe Kluson tuners have unusual \"pearly\" plastic buttons specific to this time period. While admittedly not as magnificent as a Loar this now 65+ year old mandolin is a very fine player with a powerful and well-developed sound, bright and cutting but still retaining the classic Gibson warmth underneath.. . Overall length is 28 in. (71.1 cm.), 10 in. (25.4 cm.) across at the widest point, and 1 3\/4 in. (4.4 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.).. . This mandolin is practically near mint; while showing a few superficial marks here and there it remains in exceptionally clean condition for its age, showing very little wear at all. It appears to have hardly ever been played, and we got a story with it that confirms that. Apparently it was purchased new by the patriarch of a performing family, but the younger members were seduced by rock'n'roll and electricity and the mandolin was never used in the act. That's the tale passed on to us, anyway!. . The finish shows some small checking handling marks and tiny imperfections but really 1950's instruments do not come much cleaner than this 60+ years on. There is perhaps some minimal shrinkage to the tuner buttons but no deterioration, and minor plating wear to the tailpiece cover. The frets have been given a little attention, and a slightly slimmer bridge top fitted to allow lower action settings; the original is in the case pocket. This mandolin plays \"like buttah\" and it's nice to coax some sound out of it after so many decades of silence.. . The original case is also almost flawless, with very minor exterior wear. The \"Eau Du Gibsone\" vintage Kalamazoo minted smell is truly enticing when it is opened. Although by reputation the 1950s is not considered a great era for Gibson mandolins this is a fine sounding instrument that is aged in but hardly played and will likely blossom in depth and range with some actual playing time. This is pretty much a time capsule piece, they really don't come much better!

Fender Solid Body Electric Mandolin (1960), made in Fullerton, California, serial # 01909, sunburst lacquer finish, alder body, maple neck with rosewood fingerboard, original brown tolex hard shell case.. . One of Leo Fender's more obscure instrument creations, the solidbody Electric Mandolin was in production from 1957 until the 1970's but is a relatively rare item. This one shows some signs of use but generally remains in nicely original condition. It was likely assembled in late 1959 or 1960; the pots are from late 1958, coded 8-47. The slab rosewood fingerboard neck carries no pencil date, typical for that time frame. Most extant examples date to the 1950s; later rosewood-board \"Mandocasters\" are rare items from any year.. . The Fender Mandolin differs from most other electrics (and all acoustic mandolins) in having only four strings instead of the usual doubled courses. This follows the ideas of the mostly western swing players who were instrumental in helping develop Fender instruments, and is also sometimes seen in Bigsby electric mandolins. This results in a clearer more brilliant electric sound without the natural \"chorusing\" effect of doubled strings, albeit one that sounds as much like an octave guitar as a mandolin.. . This instrument is also just ridiculously cute, resembling more than anything else a \"just hatched\" baby Precision Bass. All the early 1960s Fender features are there in miniature, including the clay-dot slab rosewood fingerboard on a maple neck with the classic Fender headstock, sunburst finish on an alder body, tortoise celluloid pickguard, flat-top chrome knobs and brown plastic-covered single coil pickup. The tuners are single line plastic-button strip Klusons. The '50's style thin script gold logo decal has no model name; \"Mandocaster\" is the collectors' slang for these but Fender just called it the Electric Mandolin. The brown Tolex case is also a miniature version of the standard guitar case, and is kind of adorable as well.. . Overall length is 25 7\/8 in. (65.7 cm.), 10 1\/16 in. (25.6 cm.) wide at lower bout, and 1 5\/8 in. (4.1 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 13 3\/4 in. (349 mm.). Width of nut is 1 3\/16 in. (30 mm.).. . This is a nicely original instrument showing some play wear but no alterations. The original sunburst finish is a subtle three-tone blend with very little red hue, appearing pretty much two-tone. Some of this is fade but it looks like the there was not much red sprayed on to begin with. The body has a collection fairly random dings, scuffs, scratches, and dents, but no really heavy wear. The pickguard has some minor shrinkage but no split or popped corners, with some minor scuffing on the face. The back of the neck is worn to the wood up through the 5-6th fret area.. . The instrument is all original except the chromed snap-on bridge cover has gone missing and the buttons on the original Kluson Deluxe strip tuners are replacements. '59 era plastic buttons are renowned for crumbling; the shafts show a bit of scarring from someone possible tuning with pliers long ago! The fret have been dressed down a bit and the fingerboard has some minor wear. This is a fine playing and sounding Fender Mandolin, a fairly rare dawn-of-the-'60s variation that does not turn up much. It resides in the original brown Tolex HSC, generally well preserved with one broken latch.

True red sunburst finish. This mandolin was loved - the first owner sent it back to Gibson around 1922 to have a truss rod installed. Gibson also fitted the new 2 piece bridge and provided a new green lined hard shell case. Back then, when your instrument needed work, you sent it back to the factory. The local luthier as we know them today did not exist except possibly in the big cities. Gibson installed the truss rod right through the existing peghead inlay. This was common practice at Gibson for refits. The hardware and finish are original as seen by the Waverly tuners and the clamp mounted pickguard. The nice thing is you get the best of both - the slightly wider neck of the non-truss rodded instrument, but with all of the Loar era improvments. When I bought it, the rear seam behind the tailpiece was starting to open up. Master luthier Gail Hester perfectly reglued the seam and set up the mandolin. You cannot tell the work was done. The nice woods compliment the sound. This is a exceptionally good sounding F4 with that wonderful woody round hole Gibson tone, and it plays beautifully.

Gibson H-4 Model Carved Top Mandola (1916), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 35706, red sunburst varnish finish, maple back and rim, spruce top; laminated mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, original black hard shell case.. . This is a lovely sounding 1916 Gibson H-4 Mandola, the middle instrument in the mando-trio that the early 20th Century Gibson company avidly promoted. This is Gibson's scroll-body equivalent to the viola, designed to fill the same orchestral role. While built in the largest relative quantity in the 1910's mandolas from any period are far from common, even at the time rarely seen outside the confines of the mandolin orchestra.. . The H-4 was the fanciest, most expensive Mandola Gibson offered in the 1910s priced at $125 (plus case). This was a substantial sum for a fairly limited-use instrument, even when Gibson teacher\/agents promoted sales by offering time payment options. The H-4 was produced only in relatively small numbers and is one of the rarest of the mandolin orchestra pieces the Kalamazoo company sold at the time.. . A direct companion to the F-4 mandolin, the H-4's larger scroll body and deep red sunburst finish make it a visually striking instrument, with Gibson's signature flowerpot inlay on the art nouveau-styled headstock. It features a two-piece back and sides of subtly flamed maple; despite Gibson's catalog descriptions, at this time only Style 4 instruments were actually built with the specified maple body. The top, back, sides and neck feature a beautiful dark, rich red sunburst finish and are single bound in grained ivoroid. The headstock carries a slanted pearl script Gibson logo and Handel strip tuners with grained ivoroid buttons. The pickguard is the usual elevated tortoise celluloid piece, with the 1910's metal bracket clamp.. . This mandola is well past its 100th birthday and remains a exquisitely styled, easy playing and excellent sounding instrument with a smooth and powerful tone suitable for a variety of musical styles, some of which are still waiting to be discovered!. . Overall length is 28 3\/4 in. (73 cm.), 11 in. (27.9 cm.) wide at lower bout, and 2 1\/16 in. (5.2 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 15 3\/4 in. (400 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/4 in. (32 mm.).. . This mandola shows some general play wear but is in excellent structural shape even after 105+ years. The original finish is still bright and bold with some typical micro-checking. It shows typical wear, with noticeable pick marks above the fingerboard between the front edge and soundhole being the most obvious. The rest of the finish has mostly minor dings and dents; the center of the back has some finish loss from what may have been something affixed there long ago, possibly a large floral decal. The finish on the back of the neck is partially worn down to the primer and just to the wood in places, evidence of some dedicated play time probably long ago.. . A spruce grain crack has been glued up coming off the front edge of the body 1\/2\" above the fingerboard; there was no touch up added to the finish. There is a very small grain split to the area just above the lower point, fully sealed and solid with a tiny touch up. The top of original one-piece bridge has been lowered a bit but retains the original character. The frets have been leveled and crowned and playability is excellent; the bone nut is old but may not be original.. . This is not a pristine instrument but remains simply a beautiful mandola with a wonderful sound, deep and rich but still with plenty of bark and presence. It still resides in the original HSC, with some ancient (and unfortunately crumbling) period Gibson Celluloid string packets in the pocket. This is really a lovely reminder of Gibson's original mission to perfect the mandolin orchestra in America, still a fabulous player's piece for any Mandola application, old or new!

Gibson's EM-150, their first electric mandolin model, was introduced in the early 1930's as essentially an A-style mandolin body equipped with a Charlie Christian pickup and volume and tone knobs.

Gibson Style H-1 Model Carved Top Mandola (1915), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 30622, natural varnish finish, birch back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, black tolex hard shell case.. . This is a well-used just-about 110 year old example of an early Gibson Style H-1 Mandola, showing noticeable repair and finish work but still with a lot of life left in it. The H-1 was the \"basic\" mandola, the middle-pitched instrument of the mandolin-mandola-mandocello trio. Compared to mandolins, mandolas from any era are fairly rare, although more were made in the 1910's than later periods this is still a fairly scarce item well over a century on. The H-1 lacks the decorative elements of the higher priced H-2 but is structurally the same. The headstock face has no ornament except the \"The Gibson\" inlaid in pearl, and the top has two half-herringbone soundhole rings.. . This H-1 was made in 1915, by which point Gibson's carved-top mandolin family instruments were indisputably the most influential in the world. Typical period features include a natural \"pumpkin top\" varnish finish top over lightly cherry stained back and sides, a tailpiece with Gibson-engraved cover and the Handel-made strip tuners used on all Gibsons of the period. The top is carved from spruce, over birch back and sides. The neck is Honduras mahogany fitted with a heavy bound ebony fingerboard. While not the prettiest or most original of these this is a lovely sounding and fine playing example ready for another century at least.. . Overall length is 28 1\/4 in. (71.8 cm.), 11 1\/16 in. (28.1 cm.) width, and 2 in. (5.1 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 15 3\/4 in. (400 mm.). Width of nut is 1 5\/16 in. (33 mm.).. . This Mandola has seen some life along the way, and shows the scars of almost 99 years here and there. The original thin varnish finish is intact on the back and headstock, lightly overfinished and\/or polished out on the top and neck and entirely replaced on the sides. There is some typical fine checking to the original areas and general wear with chips, dings and scrapes. The top finish retains a nice amber patina with some staining (likely from a disintegrating celluloid pickguard) dings and scrapes but less pick wear than many.. . There are no visible crack repairs. The back was removed at some point and two extra braces added in a \"V\" pattern under the bridge, along with a thin spruce patch. This means the back\/side seams have been resealed but it is a neat job there are no really noticeable scars from the process. The work to the top was no doubt done to remedy sagging in the center, which it has mostly done although there are still a minor depression under the treble side bridge foot.. . The hardware remains original with the exception of the pickguard, which is long gone. The tuners, tailpiece and bridge all remain in solid and relatively clean condition. The instrument retains the original thin 1915 frets with no really notable wear. Considering the work done this is still an attractive instrument and a very good player, with a warm and lovely sound.

Along with Gibson and Lyon & Healy, Vega was one of the major players in the mandolin market of the 1900-1920s. Most of their design were either Italianate bowlbacks (early on) or the unique \"Cylinder back\" models they pioneered in the 1910s. This Model 201 is neither, but a conventional bent-top teardrop shaped instrument similar to those made by several different Chicago companies including Harmony and the Larson Brothers.. . The Model 201 was Vega's budget full-line instrument, plainly appointed and relatively simple to build but still made of high quality materials. The back, sides and neck are mahogany, the top is tight-grained spruce and the fingerboard genuine ebony. The top is multi-bound and the soundhole trimmed with an ivoroid border and a half-herringbone strip. The pickguard is inlaid into the top and the tuners and tailpiece are standard period fittings. This model retailed at $30 around 1930, marking at as a fully professional quality instrument by the standards of the day despite its fairly plain appearance. This is a very good sounding mandolin, with a daintier tone than the more familiar Gibsons but a surprisingly powerful sound nonetheless.. . Overall length is 24 7\/16 in. (62.1 cm.), 9 3\/8 in. (23.8 cm.) across at the widest point, and 2 7\/16 in. (6.2 cm.) in depth at side, taken at the end block. Scale length is 13 5\/8 in. (346 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/16 in. (27 mm.).. . This is a very well preserved instrument for being at least 90 years old, showing some light typical wear but all original and in fine playing condition. The top has some strumming wear off the front and back edges of the pickguard, and some general light checking and a few dings and scratches. The back and sides are similar, while the neck has just a couple of feelable dinks, the largest behind the 4th fret area. The neck is quite straight with a slight typical kick-up over the body but not enough to affect playability. The original bar frets show very little wear.

Gibson A-Junior Snakehead Model Carved Top Mandolin (1928), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 82977, brown stain finish, birch back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingrboard, original black hard shell case.. . This is a great-playing and sounding original A-Junior mandolin from early 1928, some time after the \"Loar era\" at Gibson, but still embodying many of \"Master Loar's\" ideas. This is a lovely example of Gibson's mandolin craftsmanship, even though by the time it was built the company's focus had shifted primarily to banjos. \"Snakeheads\" are generally considered the best-sounding roundhole \"A\" style mandolins ever made, revered for their unmatched tone and projection compared to earlier or later A-models. Although the A-Junior was the lowest priced model offered this one certainly bears this out.. . \"Snakehead\" instruments are named for their Loar-designed peghead that angles inward towards the tip, a feature inexplicably abandoned by Gibson not long after this one was made. While this basic A-Junior lacks some of the other advanced features of the era (it does not have an adjustable truss rod or height-adjustable bridge) it does sport Loar's slimmer neck profile and sleeker peghead shape. The finish is a clear lacquer coat over an overall brown stain; this is the period when Gibson was switching from varnish to lacquer finishes and the results were sometimes inconsistent. This one is shinier than some but appears all original.. . There is no binding at all, but the same tortoise celluloid pickguard as the higher grade models is secured by the later '20s side bracket clamp. The tailpiece has a simple \"clamshell\" cover plate and the tuners are plain openback strips. Even this most basic \"A\" model is a very fine instrument, with sonic and playing improvements carrying over from \"Master Loar's\" tenure still evident in the later 1920s, and nearly 100 years on making for a very fine (if plain looking) mandolin.. . Overall length is 25 3\/4 in. (65.4 cm.), 10 1\/4 in. (26 cm.) wide, and 1 7\/8 in. (4.8 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 3\/16 in. (30 mm.).. . This 95 year old mandolin appears to have seen comparatively little use since new, remaining an excellent player with a lively sound. The original lacquer finish has a lovely aged patina, still shiny with just typical fairly minor dings, dents, and scrapes overall, with some wear-through to the unbound edges. The top in particular remains quite clean and largely free of the typical pick wear. There are no visible crack or other repairs.. . All hardware remains original and complete including the tuners, tailpiece and pickguard. The neck has remained true for 95 years and the original frets are very clean, probably polished out a bitt but showing hardly any wear. This an excellent example of Gibson's plainest 1920s A Model, cleaner than most and complete in its original hard shell case that is nicely preserved as well.

Gibson Style A Snakehead Model Carved Top Mandolin (1927), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 81712, black top, dark stained back and sides finish, birch back and sides, spruce top, mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, original black hard shell case.. . This is a clean, great-playing and sounding original Style A-1 mandolin from mid- 1927, the \"post-Loar era\" at Gibson. These Loar-pattern \"Snakeheads\" are generally considered the best-sounding oval-hole A style mandolins ever made, and this one certainly bears this out. This is a fine example of Gibson's continued craftsmanship at the end of the mandolin era, as the company's focus was shifting to banjos and then guitars.. . These \"Snakehead\" instruments are named for their Loar-designed peghead that angles inward towards the tip, a feature inexplicably abandoned by Gibson not long after this one was made. They are revered for their unmatched tone and projection and have the other advanced features of the era including the adjustable truss rod in the neck, raised adjustable bridge, and very slim neck profile. The top on this Style A bears a striking black lacquer finish, bound in white celluloid with a thin double inlaid soundhole ring with a celluloid center. The tailpiece has the engraved \"The Gibson\" cover plate and the tuners are simple strips with composite buttons. The headstock has a silkscreen \"The Gibson\" logo, oriented straight across instead of the slanted angle used previously.. . These distinctive \"snakehead\" A mandolins have long been sought-after by discerning players. Lloyd Loar's tenure as acoustic engineer at Gibson has become so mythical that sometimes separating fact from fiction is difficult. Certainly the mandolin family instruments made during the period of his employment are the most perfectly realized in Gibson's history, and have become the template for most similar instruments since.. . The mandolins of this period show the influence of a master player on both design and execution, although other Gibson employees (especially Thaddeus McHugh and Lewis A. Williams) actually engineered many of the technical improvements of the early 1920's. Loar was primarily concerned with 'voicing' the instruments properly; the Master Model Style 5 line was his greatest contribution but all Gibson mandolin family instruments were refined and improved at the same time. Even this fairly basic \"A\" model has sonic and playing improvements benefitting from \"Master Loar's\" input that are still evident today, nearly 100 years on.. . Overall length is 25 3\/4 in. (65.4 cm.), 10 in. (25.4 cm.) wide, and 1 7\/8 in. (4.8 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/16 in. (27 mm.).. . This is a lovely, beautifully original \"Snakehead\" A showing only very minor wear, wear really looking not too much used over the last 95 years. The finish has some noticeable checking to the top and headstock face. There is finer checking on the back with some small spots flaked off; that is sometimes the case with Gibsons from right around this time when they were still perfecting their lacquer finishing technique. Overall the instrument shows some small dings, dents and scrapes but no really heavy wear.. . There is no evidence of any crack repairs, as is common a couple of spots along the back\/edge seams look to have been resealed. All hardware is original and intact including the tuners, bridge, tailpiece and cover. The pickguard has a small spot of celluloid outgassing on the back edge that has been stabilized with Epoxy; the support bar underneath has been replaced (that glued-on is often the source of any celluloid issues). The original frets have been neatly dressed and the mandolin plays and sounds spectacular, with a powerful bark and a huge ring. It still resides in its original hardshell case, a bit worn but fully intact.

Gibson Model A-3 Model Carved Top Mandolin (1919), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 56097, white lacquer top, dark stained back and sides finish, birch back and sides, spruce top; mahogany neck with ebony fingerboard, original black hard shell case.. . This is a lovely 1919 example of one of the Gibson Company's most unusual looking and attractive mandolins, the Ivory-topped Style A-3. Gibson made many variations in the top color on their mandolin line in the teens and twenties, at various times offering black, brown, orange and red sunburst on different models. The striking \"Antique Ivory\" finish on this instrument was unique to the A-3, and only available on this mandolin between 1918 and 1923. Although a few other Gibsons were rarely custom ordered to match, this finish was unique to the single model and not revived after it was discontinued in 1923.. . The striking white top is double bound with a wide ivoroid soundhole ring encircled by three-ply wood on either side. The pickguard is grained ivoroid as is the bracket anchor, a very attractive looking material used only on banjo fittings besides this lone mandolin model. The back and fingerboard are single bound, the peghead sharply slanted THE GIBSON\" script logo and inlayed vine pattern. The tuners are the typical period openbacks, the original one-piece compensated bridge and engraved tailpiece are all intact. Overall this is a fine playing and sounding example of this striking and singular Gibson mandolin.. . Overall length is 25 3\/4 in. (65.4 cm.), 10 1\/4 in. (26 cm.) width, and 1 13\/16 in. (4.6 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/4 in. (32 mm.).. . This just about 103 year old instrument remains in nicely original condition with only some typical playing wear. There is scuffing and checking to the finish with dings, scratches and dents overall. There is a thin area worn away from arm action on the upper face and some dings and scrapes through the white lacquer, but generally the top is still quite attractive. The back has some more scratching, with an area worn away in the center and some finish is worn through to the wood on the back of the neck and under the lower heel.. . No repairs are visible, not even the typical seam separations often seen on old Gibsons. It remains all original, the original small frets have been dressed down a bit but still play well. The instrument includes the original hard case, this is not only a beautiful art Nouveau gem but a fine player's A-3 with a bright and powerful sound, well past its 100th birthday and ready for 100 more!

Gibson F-5 Model Carved Top Mandolin (1941), made in Kalamazoo, Michigan, serial # 97418, sunburst lacquer finish, maple back, sides and neck, spruce top, ebony fingerboard, original black hard shell case.. . This is a generally nicely preserved example of a very late pre-War F-5, Gibson's perennial top-of-the-line mandolin. This rarely-seen instrument was built in 1941 and shipped out in 1942 at the height of the swing era. At this point interest in mandolins was at low ebb and looming wartime supply issues caused Gibson to curtail most instrument production.. . 30 years earlier Gibson was a mandolin company that also made guitars; by this date guitars were all the rage with mandolins only sold in very small numbers. All Gibson mandolins from this period are rare, but the very expensive ($250 plus case) F-5s were built in miniscule numbers. Available production totals indicate 12 shipped out of Kalamazoo in 1941, with a further 17 in 1942 and the last 6 stragglers in 1943. This instrument is marked as #1 of a batch with factory order number 5220, built in mid-late 1941. Most if not all F-5's shipped in 1942-3 appear to belong to this same batch, which was probably the factory's last pre-war run of the model.. . The original F-5 was Lloyd Loar's baby in 1922-25, the flagship of the Gibson \"Master Model\" line and the most expensive and innovative mandolin in the world. Loar and the Gibson team's re-design of Gibson's earlier instruments essentially invented the modern mandolin, including now taken for granted features like the adjustable bridge and truss rod neck.. . These instruments were designed for classical and ensemble playing; Bill Monroe would not use one to invent bluegrass until the 1940s. After Loar's departure, the F-5 took a back seat to banjos and then guitars. By the time the Depression hit very few people were interested in plunking down $250 for a mandolin, and it stayed that way until Monroe's playing caused new interest on the model in the '50s.. . This 1941 F-5 has many detail differences from the Loar-era models, but is similar in most major respects. The asymmetrical body with upper scroll and two points on treble side has a carved spruce top with violin-style f-holes. It is triple-bound top and back with a rich sunburst finish on all surfaces and a stunning flame figure on the maple back. The single-piece flame maple neck has an ebony fretboard with side stripe binding, pearl block inlays from the first fret, and treble side extension with a total of 29 frets raised above the body.. . The triple-bound headstock has a pearl Fleur-de-lys inlay in place of the traditional F-5 \"flower pot\". This was used previously on the lower priced F-7 model, after they were discontinued it migrated to these late F-5s. The large pre-war \"Gibson\" script logo is inlaid above it on the peghead. The gold-plated Kluson openback tuners have pearl buttons, another F-5 trademark.. . While many consider the 1940s to not be the greatest era for Gibson mandolins this is a very fine-sounding instrument, with plenty of volume, tonal clarity without losing depth and a great \"chop.\" \"Loars\" are the traditional bluegrass standard, but Sam Bush and Barry Mitterhoff are two virtuoso players who have performed for decades on F-5s from this late pre-war period and this is definitely a world-class mandolin worthy of a master.. . Overall length is 27 9\/16 in. (70 cm.), 10 1\/16 in. (25.6 cm.) wide at lower bout, and 1 11\/16 in. (4.3 cm.) in depth, measured at side of rim. Scale length is 14 in. (356 mm.). Width of nut is 1 1\/8 in. (29 mm.).. . This mandolin is in generally well-preserved original condition, showing some repair and maintenance over the decades but not a lot of actual play wear. Overall it is one of the nicer period F-5's we have ever seen. There finish shows some typical checking, but only small dings, dents and a few pick marks. The area around the bridge has some minor scarring as is typical. The headstock face shows some minor chipping, the edge of the binding piece at the apex of the body point by the cutaway has some finish chipping.. . As with many Gibson mandolins from this period, the neck on this F-5 was almost certainly originally underset from the factory, and the instrument's state of preservation may be at least partially attributable to the fact that as built it simply did not play that well! To rectify this it has had a very well done neck re-set, which is a complex procedure on an F-5 and the results are excellent. This of course means some overfinish was done to the neck and heel area, but it is very finely blended and really only visible under blacklight inspection. The binding was replaced on the bass side of the fingerboard only, again a superbly neat job.. . In addition to the corrected neck angle, the original small frets have been crowned a bit but still retain good height. The nut is newer. The area of the top just above the center seam has a sealed grain split, running from under the tailpiece to just south of the bridge. Another very small grain split runs up from the lower ball of the bass side F-hole. These have been repaired solidly but visibly, with only minimal finish touchup.. . The adjustable bridge is a very fine repro bridge in the original style, down to the small-gauge adjustment wheels. The tailpiece is probably not original to this mandolin but is all vintage Gibson parts, the base appearing to be a silver plated F-5 piece from the 1920's and the cover the standard nickel unit from the same period. Oddly enough the mounting screws and celluloid endpin are original to this exact period, so it is possible the tailpiece is pieces scrounged from around the Gibson factory in 1942. The bound tortoise celluloid pickguard appears original but the gold-plated mounting bracket is a correct newer repro.. . The mandolin now plays the way it was intended to, with a moderately low action and room to go higher or lower as desired. The sound is crisp and quite powerful, and we expect it will deepen and mature even more if given some serious play time, something this instrument does not appear to have seen too much of since the last Roosevelt administration! The original shaped case is included, with some external wear but quite solid. Overall this is a wonderful package of pre-war Gibson 8-string goodness, a rare gem indeed.

You won't see a Ronnie Barnes mandolin come up for sale very often. This one was custom made for me, completed in 1998 (Barnes Master Model 98-0001). Advancing age and health issues dictate that I put this pampered instrument on the market.. . I first became aware of Ronnie Barnes's mandolins when I was captured by the tone of one being played by Lou Reid on albums recorded with his band \"Carolina\" in the early-to-mid 1990s. In an obituary published just after Ronnie's untimely death at age 64 in 2019, BLUEGRASS TODAY called Ronnie \"one of the most talented and creative bluegrass musicians ever to emerge from eastern Virginia...Ronnie also built fine flathead banjos, and exquisite mandolins. He was a deft and natural craftsman, whose day job prior to retirement was as a model maker for NASA...\". . My Barnes Master Model has maple back and sides, Sitka spruce top, X-bracing, 9.5-inch radiused fingerboard, lacquer finish, fat frets, and Price tailpiece.. . This mandolin has a few very minor blemishes, and very minor fret wear. It has had only light use (I am a mere living room dabbler). It has seldom been out of the house, and has spent most of the last 10 years in a safe. However, I have had a few opportunities to have the instrument evaluated by accomplished mandolinists. I took the Barnes the national convention of the Mandolin Society of America in 1998, where it elicited favorable comments from Butch Baldassari and Tony Williamson. Mandolin teacher and recording artist Tom Espinola, my son's mandolin teacher decades ago, characterized its tone as \"silky.\" In 2007, Orrin Star picked on it and said it sounded like a \"mature\" instrument.. . More photos may be viewed in a Google Photos album here:. https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/P67zVc2ntYMGADeU6. . The instrument comes with a deluxe Calton case, in blue.. . When I was updating my insurance coverage in 2009, I queried Ronnie, who sent me a handwritten letter dated Sept. 8, 2009, stating \"the replacement cost of your mandolin would be $6,500.\" My 2022 price: $4,900, plus actual shipping costs.. . I will consider serious cash offers, although I may not respond immediately. No trades, please.","ImageSrc":"https:\/\/www.mandolincafe.com\/classifieds\/upload\/184219.jpg","Ad_Number":"184219","Price1":"$6,500","Price2":"$4,900"}]
